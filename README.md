# Nixie Tube Clock - __Deprecated__

_The very first circuit design for Nuvitron Nixie Tube Clocks. Now deprecated._

* `production_deprecated.hex` is the production version firmware. 

This repo serves as a personal update to that code, to make the old hardware clock much more friendly.

A much better design and full featured desing can be found [__HERE__](https://joselogreira.github.io/nixie_clock/)
